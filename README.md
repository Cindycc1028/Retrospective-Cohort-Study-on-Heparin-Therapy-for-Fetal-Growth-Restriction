Objective: This retrospective cohort study aimed to identify significant factors influencing neonatal growth outcomes in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR), with a specific focus on the role of heparin therapy.

Methods: We analyzed a dataset of 695 pregnant women, including both heparin-treated and non-treated groups. Variables such as maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at delivery, history of abortion, hypertension, diabetes, placental abnormalities, and other comorbidities were examined. Neonatal outcomes were assessed through birth weight, Apgar scores, and NICU admission status.

Results: Preliminary analysis indicates that heparin use was associated with improved birth weights and reduced incidence of severe FGR (<3rd percentile). Significant factors influencing fetal growth included gestational age at delivery, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, presence of hypertensive disorders, and history of preterm流产. Subgroup analysis revealed that heparin therapy may mitigate adverse effects in high-risk populations, such as older mothers or those with thrombophilic disorders.

Conclusion: Heparin therapy appears to have a protective effect on fetal growth in FGR pregnancies, particularly in the presence of certain maternal risk factors. Further multivariate analysis is warranted to control for confounders and validate these findings. This study supports the potential benefit of heparin in the management of FGR and highlights key prognostic factors for clinical consideration.
